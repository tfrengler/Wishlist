# Wishlist
A wishlist website, where you can add/edit and view wishes

The third iteration of one of my very first web development projects. My first few attempts at getting familiar with web development and programming/scripting was just doing test, sandbox-like websites. The wishlist is the first major project I made that has real life use.

It marked the point where I decided to throw myself in to the deep end: I was gonna tackle OOP, MCV and data handling all at once. The first version ended up being a spaghetti-soup disaster of logic and presentation all mixed together; but it worked! Turned out that MVC is very abstract and although easy to understand on paper can be a pain to do for real, especially as a newbie developer.

The second version fixed a lot of the bugs but there's only so much you can do when the core of your program is a mess so this version - the third - is a complete rewrite from scratch. There's almost 3 years between version 1 and this one so a lot of the things I learned since have been put into practice and although it may still not be a work of art it works, it's extensible and not a total pain to get into again if you need to fix stuff. Plus it works, and even better than before.

I'm proud of this thing and it might be a kind of "first love"-project that I will come back to and improve on or rewrite throughout the years. The OOP side of things worked well already in the first version with the third not nailing, but significantly getting closer to the mark in terms of MVC. Is it overkill for what it does? Yes, but it's also a perfect of perfect size for trying out new concepts and learning things in general.

Going forward I might want to do more server side stuff with this, change up the structure (MVC-wise) and one day use a database for the data. For now the XML-based solution works fine and is good enough really. I just didn't want to tackle both OOP, MVC and SQL all at once back then.
